# AnyImage-MouseCursor
A javascript project, that lets you upload any image to the webpage and it instantly changes the mouse cursor to the uploaded image. As we can only make an image a mouse cursor if it has a max aspect ratio of 120ps X 120px, I made some integration of function that coverts the image to 40x40 px first, then uploads it to the server and changes the cursor accordingly. It also allows you to paste valid links to directly fetch the cursor source from the link. I made some pre-added styles also. used php for the server side. You need a server to run this project btw.
here is a live link of this project(hosted and running)
